## Getting Started

All solutions live in the `/lib` directory.

If you are only interested in seeing the solutions in Ruby, ignore the steps below. They pertain to tests written in Rspec to make sure the solution covers various cases and behaves as intended.

To run the tests:

1. Download/clone repository.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the repo via terminal/command line interface.
4. Run the command `bundle install` to install all dependencies.
5. Once this has completed run the command `rspec` to run all the tests.
6. Or, to run a specific test,  run the command `rspec spec/ch01/1.01_spec.rb` for example.
