# Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition (Ruby Solutions)

These are solutions to the questions to Cracking the Coding Interview 6th edition in Ruby.

## Getting Started

All solutions live in the `/lib` directory.

If you are only interested in seeing the solutions in Ruby, ignore the steps below. They pertain to tests written in Rspec to make sure the solution covers various cases and behaves as intended.

To run the tests:

1. Download/clone repository.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the repo via terminal/command line interface.
4. Run the command `bundle install` to install all dependencies.
5. Due to the nature of this project dir setup, the `rspec` command to run all tests won't work as intended.
6. Run the command `rspec spec/ch01/1.01_spec.rb` to run tests for specific problems only.
